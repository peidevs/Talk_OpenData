##### Outline for Open Data: Let's Lean Forward

This file might help illustrate the arc of the talk for those not in attendance, as the slides in isolation will be pointless.

##### Open Data (part 1)

* The presentation, and the new venture, covers a flowering ecosystem, bounty of ideas, etc.
* However, like a garden, there is hard-work: tilling, fertilizing, weeding, etc.
* We'll dig into a specific local example.
* Kerry Campbell tweeted about "10 minutes with a calculator" to sum a column (from PDF).
    * Kerry did the best he could, given the cards he was dealt: a PDF.
    * How do we know the result is correct? How can we leverage Kerry's work?
* I took 2 hours to liberate the PDF to a simple CSV.
    * Now it can be imported into a spreadsheet. We can write programs with it, etc.
    * We are only limited by our imagination, not by the technology.
* Three essential elements of Open Data:
    * accessible (online, non-proprietary format)
    * machine readable (PDF is evil)
    * explicit, permissive license
* I won't publish CSV because PDF wasn't licensed; I don't have time to investigate "fair use", or the default in PEI, etc 
* gov'ts typically publish "data sets" to a server called a portal or catalogue
    * these sites often have search and basic graphic capabilities

##### Open Data (part 2)

* My cousin asked about Open Data, and was asleep 3 minutes into my explanation.
* Offered him an app example involving health-care for his infant son, and he physically **leaned forward** in interest. This is **precisely** *civic engagement*.
* I was dealing with fertilizing the garden; my cousin wants the harvest. Apps, visualizations, info-graphics can enlighten, outrage, pique curiosity, etc.
* Example: worst parking space in NYC. The talk illustrates a cycle of:
    * data access
    * insight
    * engagement (i.e. *leaning forward*)
    * taking action
    * effecting change
* For software developers, we deal with code frameworks all the time. Here, Ben Wellington found a bug in the "civic framework", submitted a patch, and it was accepted. Tremendous satisfaction!
* Example: farmers in Uganda. No matter if Uganda or Morell, any farmer will lean forward re: crop yields.
* Team Data Mission Statement: a masterpiece
    * Responsibly (i.e. respect privacy concerns)
    * unleash (i.e. convert potential energy between nerds, gov't actors, engaged citizens)
    * ROI (which resonates with business and gov't)

##### Open Data Book Club (intro)

* circa 2007, a man in Ottawa scraped skating-rink hours from website, created Google Maps mash-up
* today, Ottawa has full-blown open data culture (the flowery garden)
* Open Data Book Club:
    * monthly MeetUp of software devs, librarians, gov't reps, citizens
    * each month they study **a data set**
    * visualizations, hack night, etc

##### Open Data Book Club (for PEI)

* I propose that we start one as an offshoot from PEI Developers
* logistics:
    * Fall 2015
    * monthly meeting
    * diverse, as in Ottawa
* challenge: must fertilize & till the garden
    * advocate Open Data with gov't
    * crowd-source/curate Open Data (We need examples that make people lean forward. They can be compelling, or trite [if fun]). 
    * spoonful of sugar (apps, visualizations) helps the medicine go down (Open Data agenda)
    * bonus: can we help non-profit organizations? seniors? those less fortunate?
    * some nights might include info sessions on
        * statistics
        * info-graphic design
        * journalism (fair use etc)
        * legal / ethics

##### Open Data Book Club (finale)

* If a 6-year-old girl draws a photo of her community, she might include a school, fire department, police department, hospital, church etc.
* Where are the nerds in this picture? As a social institution? As a role model?
* What if there was a maker-space (not addressed here, but would be awesome)
* What if there was a group that effected change, here on PEI... a Volunteer Data Department?
* This might be the beginning of something special. Let's lean forward, together.
